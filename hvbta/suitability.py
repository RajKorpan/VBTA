def build_name_only_prompt(robots_json: str, tasks_json: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You score robot–task suitability using ONLY each task's name and a short description (if provided).
Infer typical requirements from the task name (and description), then score how suitable each robot is.
Do not include code fences, explanations, or any text outside of the score matrix. Do not include comments.
The matrix must be exactly N rows (robots) by M columns (tasks).

INPUT (JSON)
Robots:
{robots_json}

Tasks (only names + optional nl_description):
{tasks_json}

Scoring principles (follow closely)
- No hard-fail zeros unless the robot is blatantly incapable for the *typical* demands implied by the task name.
- Infer likely needs from the name/description, e.g.:
  · "item elevation" → hoisting/cable hoist, long reach, stable placement.
  · "excavate" → hydraulic bucket, traction (tracked), high payload, rugged sensors.
  · "lay bricks" → dispenser/gripper, precise alignment, moderate reach, stable placement.
  · "scaffold" → work near frames at height, drill/gripper, precise alignment, narrow access.
  · "delivery" → mobility/endurance, small payload capacity, navigation through corridors.
  · "utilities" → gripper operation of valves/switches, precise manipulation; or bucket variant for bulk.
  · "debris" → gripper variant (pick-and-place) vs bucket variant (bulk scooping).
- Consider: manipulators, mobility type, payload capacity, reach, sensor suite, comms/safety, autonomy level, processing power, battery/endurance.
- Use soft weights; if a capability is somewhat relevant but not mandatory, give partial credit rather than 0.
- Calibrate to avoid trivial 0.0/1.0: clamp to [0.05, 0.99] unless obviously perfect (1.0) or clearly mismatched (~0.0).

Output format (STRICT)
Return ONLY:
OUTPUT
[
  [r1_t1, r1_t2, ..., r1_tM],
  [r2_t1, r2_t2, ..., r2_tM],
  ...
]
